# Bookmarks

Some people are using browser bookmarks to save something for later, but for me this never works for some reason. Saving to the bookmarks is equivalent to throwing the link to the thrash bin. Which is not good, because sometimes there are very good talks or articles with particular points made by people with solid experience (e.g. Bjarne Stroustrup talking about meta-programming with templates).

So instead I'm going to try github repo to note talks and articles of interest.

- [ ] [Programming languages](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages). Coursera course recommended to understand low level things about programming languages

- [ ] [What every progammer should know about memory](https://lwn.net/Articles/250967/).

- [x] [The Essense of C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86xWVb4XIyE), Bjarne Stroustrup.
An overview of C++ and its applications. Very good talk, with meta-programming discussed and why it's not good to create crazy structures with it, and also that inheritance is just one of the tool with no magic in it.

- [x] [Template normal programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwrXHznaYLA), Arthur O'Dwyer.
A very good introduction / in-depth review of templates in C++. It's a difficult topic and documentation on it is oftentimes absolutely useless if you are just starting. Arthur's talk is not like this, it's easy to follow and he teaches good material about templates in C++.

- [x] [All little things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bZh5LMaSmE), Sandi Metz
Interesting talk about code readability and simplicity. Though in my opinion the best result was achieved at the middle of the talk with methods and big if statement. It might not have the best metrics but it's super easy to get what's going on while reading it.
The end result with objects - in my opinion that's a big overkill for the task. If names were dynamic and created by user then it would make sense but not in that context. And if mapping from name to class with logic is stored in database - that is a hell in terms of readability, good luck finding how code is executed.

- [x] [The world's worst video card](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7rce6IQDWs), Ben Eater
How to build a video card using chips and wires. Another awesome video of the same format: [Hello world with 6502](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnzuMJLZRdU)

- [x] [Extern c: Talking to C Programmers about C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7Sd8A6_fYU), Dan Saks
Great talk about technology and psychology. Dan is a good role model for having technical discussions.
