# Bookmarks

Some people are using browser bookmarks to save something for later, but for me this never works for some reason. Saving to the bookmarks is equivalent to throwing the link to the thrash bin. Which is not good, because sometimes there are very good talks or articles with particular points made by people with solid experience (e.g. Bjarne Stroustrup talking about meta-programming with templates).

So instead I'm going to try github repo to note talks and articles of interest.
